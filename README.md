This project is a REST API developed using Django Rest Framework (DRF) that facilitates CRUD operations through API endpoints. It features serializers for data representation and validation, employs function-based and class-based views for handling requests, and utilizes viewsets and routers for efficient URL routing. The API includes robust permission and authentication systems, supports throttling to manage request rates, and provides advanced filtering, searching, and pagination capabilities. Additionally, the project incorporates automated testing to ensure the reliability of all endpoints.
